## Codebender.cc

Codebender is an online platform for wiriting sketches and uploading them to the Arduino-compatible board of your choice. It's like having a cloud based IDE for writing and debugging as well as having a cloud storage to keep and share your sketches from one place.

### Applications 

Like any cloud service, Codebener is great if you jump between different machines, but I  think that the "killer-app" for this service is in Education. Teachers and workshop leaders can prepare examples or code outlines in advance and share them with your group. 

## Setup

The setup process is very simple, and the developers have created a nice walkthrough to help you get up and running as quickly as possible. You can view their steps <a href="https://codebender.cc/static/walkthrough/page/1" target="_blank">here.</a>
