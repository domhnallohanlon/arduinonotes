# Serial Monitor

The serial monitor allow us to both send data to the Arduino and receive data from it. Typically this is achieved by sending data via the USB cable - which is what we'll cover here - but is also possible to use these techniques with Bluetooth or any other wireless protocol.

## Serial Functions

```
Serial.begin();
```

```
Serial.read();
```

```
Serial.write();
```

## Using the Serial Monitor for debugging

## Stretch Goal
 - Initialise the LEDs using an array
 - Toggle lights based on keyboard input
